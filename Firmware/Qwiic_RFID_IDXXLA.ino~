  To install support for ATtiny84 in Arduino IDE: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/master/Installation.md
  This core is installed from the Board Manager menu
  This core has built in support for I2C S/M and serial
  If you have Dave Mellis' ATtiny installed you may need to remove it from \Users\xx\AppData\Local\Arduino15\Packages

  To support 400kHz I2C communication reliably ATtiny84 needs to run at 8MHz. This requires user to
  click on 'Burn Bootloader' before code is loaded.
